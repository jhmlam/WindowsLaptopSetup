Hello World
## Introduction
In Fall 2021, I bought my [Lenovo Legion Laptop](https://amzn.to/394bXOY), it comes with the following hardware/software features:
> * Windows 10 Pro
> * [AMD Ryzen 7 5800H](https://amzn.to/3A3P8a5) at clock speed 3.2 GHz and onboard Radeon Graphics 
> * Two 3200MHz 8 GB RAM SODIMM
> * Two SKHynix 954GB SSD
> * [Nvidia RTX 3060](https://amzn.to/2Xavvi6) with 6.0 GB dedicated GPU Memory and 7.7 GB shared GPU memory

Some other accessories I found useful:
> * [A thin wireless mouse](https://amzn.to/2Xavvi6) - Light weight and rechargeable
> * [SanDisk 512GB Ultra Fit USB 3.1 Flash Drive ](https://amzn.to/3k5whWR) - This compensate the need to store semi-permanent draft data w/o hurting the SSD. I will explain further in this page.

Remark. We can check on hardware specs in Windows by the following two ways.
> * System Information
> * Task Manager Also shows performance
> * Device Manager Allow options to be executed
